# Vectoria

> [!WARNING]
> Vectoria is working-in-progress. Expect missing feature and
> unstable API.

Single-purpose vector database for AKNN (Approximate K Nearest Neighbors) search,
implementing the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds) method in Rust.

## Edge AI

Vectoria is built for edge AI, where less powerful personal device handle
some of the simple AI tasks, which is in this case vector search.
This leads to better data transparency and less operating cost.

Vector database and vector search is crucial to some of
the most important intelligent algorithms, including

- text & image embeddings inference
- similarity-based recommendations
- classification
